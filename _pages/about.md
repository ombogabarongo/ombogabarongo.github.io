Iâ€™m a Computer Security and Forensics graduate with certification in Basic Data Science and a passion for using cloud technologies(AWS) and big data to solve real-world problems. I have hands-on experience with tools like Python, MySQL, Power BI, Excel, MongoDB, Tableau, and R and a solid foundation in data protection and security analysis. 

I wish to apply my expertise in data science and cloud computing to design secure, scalable, and user-friendly systems that will  improve food distribution and reduce post-harvest losses in Africa and the world vision 2030.
