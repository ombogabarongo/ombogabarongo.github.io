1 Exploratory Data Analysis Penguin Dataset
 In my capstone project, I explored the  penguin dataset to uncover patterns in species, size, and sex differences. I began by cleaning and preparing the data, then applied Python and Seaborn to visualize trends using KDE joint plots, boxplots, histograms, scatter plots and violin plots.
 
 As I progressed, distinct patterns emerged, Gentoo penguins appeared notably larger and heavier than Adelie and Chinstrap species. Moreover, males  outweighed females across all species. By analyzing pairwise relationships, I discovered strong correlations between body mass and flipper length. Finally, I identified statistical outliers using boxplot techniques, which added depth to the species comparisons.

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis. More importantly, I demonstrated how data science can evolve biological data into meaningful ecological insights.
