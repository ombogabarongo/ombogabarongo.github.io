**1. Exploratory Data Analysis Penguin Dataset**
 In my capstone project, I explored the  penguin dataset to uncover patterns in species, size, and sex differences. I began by cleaning and preparing the data, then applied Python and Seaborn to visualize trends using KDE joint plots, boxplots, histograms, scatter plots and violin plots.
 
 As I progressed, distinct patterns emerged, Gentoo penguins appeared notably larger and heavier than Adelie and Chinstrap species. Moreover, males  outweighed females across all species. By analyzing pairwise relationships, I discovered strong correlations between body mass and flipper length. Finally, I identified statistical outliers using boxplot techniques, which added depth to the species comparisons.

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis. More importantly, I demonstrated how data science can evolve biological data into meaningful ecological insights.

**2. Information Security Administration
- **Using Microsoft Purview**

Assigned compliance roles – ensured that only authorized users (like Compliance Admins) can manage and enforce data governance policies across the organization.

 Explored the Purview portal – gained hands-on familiarity with the centralized platform used for setting up classification, labeling, and compliance policies.
 
 Created custom sensitive information types -built detection patterns using regular expressions and keyword proximity to automatically flag content containing employee IDs.
 
 Configured Exact Data Match (EDM) – set up high-accuracy data classification by defining structured employee data, securing uploads, and enabling advanced detection of exact matches in documents and emails.
 
 Developed keyword dictionaries – created supporting keyword lists to improve detection accuracy for terms related to personal identifiers like "Employee" and "ID".
 
Tested and validated classifiers – confirmed that the custom and EDM-based policies correctly identify and protect sensitive data.

**3. UkulimaSols Project **

UkulimaSOLS is a digital platform that helps smallholder farmers access markets, coordinate delivery, and use community storage. It connects farmers directly to buyers for fair pricing, streamlines produce transport, and offers shared storage to reduce post-harvest losses and improve earnings.
