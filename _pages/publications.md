- Data is exploding

Data is being created, stored, and shared faster than ever before. By 2025, it's estimated that the world will produce up to 175 zettabytes of data, a tenfold increase from 2016. This rapid growth brings new challenges for organizations trying to manage a wide range of data types, including emails, documents, instant messages, videos, and images. Generative AI adds further complexity by introducing new layers of data and risks like privacy concerns and misinformation.
Organizations must rethink how they manage and secure data to keep up. This involves updating strategies to address the growing volume and complexity of data, and new challenges posed by AI.
As data grows, so do the demands for protecting it. The need for strong controls around sensitive data is more critical than ever. Without a robust data management strategy, organizations risk financial penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust. Well-designed data management strategies help reduce these risks and ensure data security in a constantly changing landscape.

- Discovering and managing data is challenging
Managing and protecting data is a growing challenge. Research highlights that:
88% of organizations lack confidence in their ability to detect or prevent sensitive data loss.
More than 80% of corporate data remains "dark", meaning it isn't classified, protected, or governed.
Protecting and governing sensitive data is one of the biggest challenges for compliance with regulations.
Organizations need to protect sensitive data across devices, SaaS applications, and cloud services. As the environment grows more complex, so do the risks of data breaches and non-compliance.

- Solution;

Balance security and productivity
Striking the right balance between security and productivity is essential. While security features like data loss prevention (DLP) and encryption protect sensitive data, users need the ability to collaborate smoothly. Here's how tools support both goals:
 
- Security features:
 
Restrict access to sensitive data with conditional access policies based on identity, location, and device compliance.
Prevent unauthorized sharing with DLP policies across cloud and on-premises platforms.
Encrypt files and emails based on sensitivity labels, ensuring data protection at rest and in transit.
DLP to prevent data leakage, ensuring sensitive data isn't accidentally shared or exposed.
Separate business and personal data on devices, protecting organizational data without intruding on personal data.
Secure email with encryption and custom permissions to control access and actions like forwarding.
Productivity features:
 
Apply sensitivity labels across platforms like Office apps and endpoints for consistent data classification.
Provide label suggestions and tooltips to help users apply labels appropriately.
Add visual markings like watermarks and lock icons to indicate sensitive documents.
Enable secure co-authoring and collaboration across Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint.
Search encrypted files within SharePoint without compromising security.
Open and share encrypted PDFs directly in Microsoft Edge.
